# - system attributes
# these are attributes that come with any class, without the need for implementation
#   - __dict__
# objects store their attributes in a dictionary, this command displays said dictionary
print( x.__dict__ )
print()

# - the usual way
# the following is an example of defining attributes on a class level. To define attributes on an object level they must be
# declared within a method (most probably the __init__) using the self keyword as a prefix. One can define class level
# attributes within a method be using the class name as a prefix (or type(self), which is apparently a better choice) In all
# cases, the underscoring thing remains
class classWithAttributes:
    #class level attributes
    a = 10 
    b = "Hello" 
    _protectedAttribute = "dangerous stuff" # this is more of a naming convention than anything technical
    __privateAttribute = "private stuff"

print(a.a)
print(a.b)
print(a._protectedAttribute) 
# print(a.__privateAttribute) # this will return an error. Obviously; methods of this class can access this attribute freely
print()

# - dynamic attributes
# dynamically assigned attributes are attributes that you add to an object after it has been created. These are always at object level
a = SimplistClass()
b = SimplistClass()
a.name = "James" # "object level attribute"
b.name = "Conor"
print(a.name) 
print(b.name)
# simple. Notice the object's attribute list
print(a.__dict__)
print(b.__dict__)
print()
# things can become a little more complicated when you assign attributes to the class itself
SimplistClass.name = "Sarah" # "class level attribute"
# now, any object produced with this class will access the attribute 'name' from the class.
# Thus, one can change the classes attribute, effecting the results of accessing that objects
# apparent attributes
c = SimplistClass()
print(c.name)
SimplistClass.name = "Rachel"
print(c.name)
# one can see that the object does not have the attribute itself but the class does
print(c.__dict__)
print(SimplistClass.__dict__)
print()
# setting a classes attribute like this can be used for static variables of C and C++
# manually setting the object's attribute will stop the access to the class, creating 
# local attribute data
c.name = "Hannah"
print(c.name)
print(c.__dict__)
print()

# slots
# Understandably, having all objects being capable of expanding their attribute list can be costly to memory 
# efficiency. Attributes are usually stored in a dynamic dictionary, but we can force them to be stored in a 
# static dictionary with the __slots__ attribute.
class classWithSlots:
    __slots__ = ['a','b']

    def __init__(self):
        self.a = 100
        self.b = 200
        # self.c = 300      # attempting to decalare an additional object-level attribute is not allowed
# only attributes whose names were declared in that  '__slots__' list will be allowed in this object (excluding class-level attributes)
a = classWithSlots()
print(a.a)
print(a.b)
a.a = "string"          # the data stored is itself dynamic
print(a.a)
# a.c = "new Value"     # attempting to decalare an additional object-level attribute dynamically is not allowed
print()
# Apparently this inefficiency was dealt with in python3.3 with Key-Sharing Dictionaries which allow instances to share 
# part of their internal storage between one another. I'm gussing this is a clever use of pointers behind the scenes.








# -> Methods
# it's important to note that there is no overloading in python, beyond sudo overloading described later
# obviously, not having types takes away a lot of the need for overloading. Also all methods are public.
# Privacy is simulated by writing a weird mathod name (eg. "__method") the idea is that we're all supposed
# to be friends here, so go ahead and look at the interesting "private" methods; but don't use them for real

# - the usual way

x.method()
classWithMethod.method(x)
type(x).method(x)
print()
# note; the first argument of a method will be a reference to the object instance. It doesn't have
# to be the word 'self' though this is the convention. This argument must be included however. If 
# it isn't; the method is only accessable through the class (eg. class.method() works, obj.method() 
# fails) It is possible to convert this method into a full static method:
# - dynamic method

def someFunc2(self):
    return self.atr

# classWithDynamicMethod.dynamicMethod = someFunc2         # I know, right? so long as the method is in the class before it's first called, everything is fine
# print( a.dynamicMethod() )

# # -- object level addition
# # --- easy way without self
# a.dynamicMethod1 = someFunc1
# # --- difficult way with self (needs module)
# import types
# a.dynamicMethod2 = types.MethodType( someFunc2, a )
# print( a.dynamicMethod1() )
# print( a.dynamicMethod2() )

print()

# - static method
# static methods are methods on the class level. They are unable to access non-static attributes and methods.
# They also do not pay attention to inheritance, thus these methods will access the data stored only in their
# classes static attributes; even if those attributes are redefined in a derived class

# class methods are a lot like static methods with two important differences. 
# A. they have a compulsory first argument (like self, though here the conventional keyword is 'cls') This refers 
#    to the class
# B. They can access attributes local to whatever dirrived class they're being used in (thanks to cls)

# operators
# the following methods are run when mathematical or logical operations are done on an object
# the usual convertion is like so:  obj_a + obj_b   ->   obj_a.__add__(obj_b)
# thus, most operation methods have only two inputs (for self and the second object)
# Importantly; the operator of the first written object is run first, then the second is searched for a 'r' version of the operation
#   (this note is only really relevant in the case of binary operators)
# Binary Operators
#   +	        obj.__add__(self, other)
#   -	        obj.__sub__(self, other)
#   *	        obj.__mul__(self, other)
#   /	        obj.__truediv__(self, other)
#   //	        obj.__floordiv__(self, other)
#   %	        obj.__mod__(self, other)
#   **	        obj.__pow__(self, other[, modulo])      # this optional modulo argument can only be accessed through pow(a,b,c) which will convert to a.__pow__(b,c), which mathematically is (a^b)%c

#   |	        obj.__or__(self, other)
#   ^	        obj.__xor__(self, other)
# the above operations come in two additional versions, 'i' and 'r'
# - i :: obj.__iadd__(self, other)
# these are activated for immediate operations, eg. a += b  
# beyond that, everything else is the same. You could just write a return from the regular version, 
# though instead you could not return anything and write the value updates within the method
# - r :: obj.__radd__(self, other)
# these are activated for situations where the object isn't the first in the written order. This only
# really makes sense in the context of working with objects of different types, eg. obj_int + obj_custom
# beyond that, everything else is the same. You can just write a return from the regular version

# Unary Operators
#   -	        obj.__neg__(self)
